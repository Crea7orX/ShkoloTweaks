## FAQ

### Will Shkolo Tweaks support NEISPUO (НЕИСПУО)?

> Yes! It will support basic functionality that was introduced in Shkolo Tweaks *(e.g., Dark Theme; Rounded Theme)*, but nothing special for now.

### When Shkolo Tweaks is rebranding?

> We expect the start of the next school year. When the ministry of education bans 3rd-party e-diaries. It will be rebranded as "MON Tweaks" or something like that.
